# About my first project, in my first year semester 1 of university. 

I'm following a Software Engineering degree at Informatics Institute of Technology Sri Lanka. This project was assigned to us to create a progression outcome calculator project for universities. Here the university management is asked to add the credits of students and get their progression outcomes at the end of each academic year. A histogram with a detailed analysis of the progression outcomes of students is displayed at the end as per their request.
